# Project title
  **Dotfiles**:- just to store my configured files.
# vim files
#### vimrc

I have configured vim according to my needs
I have made several shortcuts for **html tags**, **cpp**.
Read *comments* in my vimrc files to know them.

# Plugins used
* [Vundle.vim](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim):- for easy installation of vim plugins.
* [NerdTree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree):- a very nice plugin for displaying files at the side of vim.
